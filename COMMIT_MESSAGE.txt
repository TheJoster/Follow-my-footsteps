feat(simulation): complete Phase 2.4 with turn-based system, multi-turn pathfinding, and comprehensive testing

Phase 2.4 Turn-Based Simulation Core:
- Add SimulationManager singleton managing Player→NPC→Processing turn cycle
- Implement ITurnEntity interface with action points system (3 AP/turn)
- Create TurnEvent ScriptableObject event system for decoupled notifications
- Add TurnCounterUI for turn state visualization
- Integrate PlayerController with turn system and action points

Multi-Turn Pathfinding System:
- Remove upfront AP consumption, add per-cell AP deduction in UpdateMovement()
- Implement auto-pause movement when AP depleted (AP=0)
- Implement auto-resume movement on next turn start
- Enable unlimited-turn pathfinding (paths span multiple turns automatically)
- Player can plan 10+ cell routes executed across multiple turns

GridVisualizer Real-Time Pathfinding Display:
- Add live pathfinding calculation for hovered cells
- Display distance (cells), total path cost, and turns required
- Show "Unreachable!" for invalid destinations
- Configurable info panel positioning (TopRight default, 250x180px)
- Calculate turns based on 3 AP per turn system

Assembly Definition Architecture:
- Create FollowMyFootsteps.asmdef (main game code assembly)
- Create FollowMyFootsteps.Editor.asmdef (editor-only scripts)
- Update FollowMyFootsteps.Tests.EditMode.asmdef (test assembly)
- Remove conflicting Grid.asmdef to fix compilation
- Establish clean compilation order: Main→Editor/Tests

Comprehensive Unit Testing (29 tests):
- SimulationManagerTests.cs (11 tests): Singleton, states, entity registration, pause
- TurnEventTests.cs (10 tests): Event raising, listeners, data propagation
- PlayerControllerTurnTests.cs (8 tests): ITurnEntity, AP consumption, turn lifecycle
- All tests passing with proper mocking and validation

Bug Fixes:
- Fix Camera namespace conflicts (Camera folder vs UnityEngine.Camera)
- Fix Input namespace conflicts (Input folder vs UnityEngine.Input)  
- Add IsPaused and RegisteredEntityCount properties to SimulationManager
- Suppress CS0108 warning for camera field
- Remove Grid.asmdef circular dependency

UI/Debug Enhancements:
- Configurable debug panels for SimulationManager (TopLeft) and GridVisualizer (TopRight)
- SimulationManager panel: Turn #, state (color-coded), entity count, player AP
- GridVisualizer panel: Cell info + pathfinding calculations (distance/cost/turns)
- No panel overlap with flexible positioning system

Documentation:
- Update README.md with Phase 2.4 achievements (14 items)
- Update SETUP_PHASE2.md with implementation details and assembly structure
- Add SETUP_PHASE2_4.md (comprehensive implementation guide, 539 lines)
- Add PHASE2_4_SUMMARY.md (quick reference with metrics, 334 lines)
- Document all 29 unit tests and test coverage

Phase Completion:
✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Systems (Hex grid, chunks, rendering)
✅ Phase 2.1: Input Abstraction Layer (PC/mobile unified)
✅ Phase 2.2: Player System with A* Pathfinding
✅ Phase 2.3: Camera Controller with Dual Path Visualization
✅ Phase 2.4: Turn-Based Simulation Core with Multi-Turn Pathfinding

Files Changed: 31 total
- New: 4 core files, 3 test files, 3 assembly definitions, 2 doc files
- Modified: 11 existing files
- Deleted: 2 conflicting assembly definition files
- Total: ~1,450 lines of production code + tests + documentation

Ready for Phase 3: Advanced Pathfinding & NPC Foundation
